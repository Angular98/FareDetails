Description:

Assuming mock service will give the response in this format:

Mock Service Response:

{
	"faredetails": [{
			"journeydetails": {
				"origin": "MAA",
				"destination": "LHR",
							}
		},
		{
			"journeydetails": {
				"origin": "DEL",
				"destination": "MAA",
				
			}
		}
	]

}


1.Using JsonNode and ObjectMapper , traversed through the response and compared the passed origin and destination with the mock service origin 
and destinations. If matches build the response with the help of domain model and return back the response.

2.Implemented Cirucit Breaker to get the "System Down" Error when service is not available

3.Implemented Hystrix Dashboard to get the desired metrics and displayed the service in Hystrix Dashboard

4.Used Spring Oauth2 and Spring security to create a token with grant type = client_credentials and username = travel-app-client and password=psw.
Without token the REST API cannot be accessed. Implemented authentication and authorization

5.Written a htmlpage which consumes a javascript code to hit the REST API and consume the response and display in the page(not fully implemented).



Doubts:
1.Didn't understand the requirement of how to set the fare value.(Once clarified will implement).
2.Didn't understand about the parallel calls(Once i get understanding will implement the code)
